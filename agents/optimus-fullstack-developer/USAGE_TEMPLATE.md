Agent: optimus-fullstack-developer
Goal: Execute one Optimus packet in automated-handoff mode with concise machine summary.

Inputs: repo_root:
Inputs: worktree_root:
Inputs: branch_name:
Inputs: start_from_branch:
Inputs: start_from_commit:
Inputs: acceptance_criteria:
Inputs: tracking_mode: automated-handoff
Inputs: packet_version:
Inputs: default_branch: main
Inputs: complexity_hint: medium
Inputs: changed_files_hint:
Inputs: test_focus:
Inputs: constraints:
Inputs: fallback_branch_suffix: -dev
Inputs: db_seed_profile: minimal
Constraints: No Linear updates. No orchestration file writes. Minimum checks required for acceptance criteria only. Summary must be concise and emoji-free. If DB-facing behavior changes, developer must keep `reset -> migrate -> seed` runnable on a task-scoped temporary DB and update seed/reset scripts as needed (explicit DB URL targeting required).
Output: Code changes + task commit(s) + strict concise summary for Optimus
```
